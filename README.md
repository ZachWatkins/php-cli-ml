# PHP CLI for Machine Learning

This is a simple command-line interface for applying machine learning to Pokemon data. It uses Pokemon data from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and the Rubix ML library to train a classifier to predict the habitat of a Pokemon given other attributes like type(s), growth rate, egg group(s), color, height, weight, and shape.
